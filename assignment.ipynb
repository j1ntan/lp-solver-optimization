    "\n",
    "You are tasked with optimizing the **loading of packages into Unit Load Devices (ULDs)** - large containers used to efficiently transport cargo in aircraft. Your goal is to design a mathematical model that can **pack a set of 3D boxes into a fixed-size ULD** such that:\n",
    "\n",
    "- All items are **non-overlapping** and **fully contained** within the ULD bounds.\n",
    "- Constraints related to **weight balance**, **orientation**, and **priority items** (if introduced) are respected.\n",
    "- The objective is to either:\n",
    "    - **Maximize the number of items packed**, or\n",
    "    - **Maximize the total packed volume/weight**, depending on the variation.\n",
    "\n",
    "This mimics real-world logistics problems faced by FedEx and other cargo companies, where space and weight utilization directly impact cost and efficiency."
